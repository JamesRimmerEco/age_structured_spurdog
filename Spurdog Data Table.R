# Spurdog Life Table Generator
# -------------------------------
# This script creates a life table for spurdogs by combining mortality and fertility data.
# It assumes that 'mort_data' is already loaded in your workspace with the following columns:
#   a            : Age index from 1 to 61 (where a=1 corresponds to age 0-1, a=2 to 1-2, etc.)
#   survival_prob: Probability of surviving from the current age to the next
#
# Fertility (b‚Çê) is defined for ages 9 and older using the following schedule:
#   Ages 9 to 11  : 25% mature, 4 pups
#   Ages 12 to 14 : 30% mature, 7 pups
#   Ages 15 to 17 : 55% mature, 8 pups
#   Ages 18 to 20 : 70% mature, 10 pups
#   Ages 21 to 26 : 80% mature, 11 pups
#   Ages 27+     : 100% mature, 11 pups
#
# After accounting for a 2-year gestation and a 1:1 sex ratio, each calculated fertility value is divided by 4.
#
# The final CSV ("spurdog_life_table.csv") will have the following three columns:
#   a  : Age class (starting at 0)
#   S_a  : Survival probability from mort_data
#   b_a  : Adjusted fertility rate
